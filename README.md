# ABOUT
This is my and Rickards project in ProjInda at KTH
This game is called TANKS and is made using python and pygame

The current outline of the game is to play 1v1 using one computer.
The long term goal though is to play against a computer controlled bot. 

The game takes place on a map with rectangular objects used as protection and obstacles, which you cant drive on. 
You win by shooting your opponent with bullets, and after three direct hits you win, that will say both players have 3 lives. 
The first version of the project only has one map but an improvement to the game would be to create multiple maps and levels

# HOW TO PLAY

You also have to download pygame using pip. 
Clonde the directory ProjInda
after installation of the appropriate software lister above you simlpy run the game using a text editor (we use VScode)
