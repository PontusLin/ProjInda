# ProjInda
This is my and Rickards project in ProjInda at KTH
This game is called TANKS and is made using python and pygame
The main goal of the game is to defeat a bot controlled by the computer by shooting at it. 
The game takes place on a map with rectangular objects used as protection and obstacles. 
The first version of the project only has one map but an improvement to the game would be to create multiple maps and levels
