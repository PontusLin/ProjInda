# ABOUT

This is my and Rickards project in ProjInda at KTH
This game is called TANKS and has been made using python and pygame.


You play one on one, two tanks controlled by players.
The game takes place on a map with rectangular objects used as protection and obstacles, which you cant drive through. 
Both players have three lives. You win by shooting your opponent with bullets, and after three direct hits you win.
The first version of the project only has one map but an improvement to the game would be to create multiple maps and levels.

# Requirements
1. Python3
2. pygame (install using Pip for example)

# How to play
